Q... What is dictionary in python? Explain with an example.

A dictionary is an associative array (also known as hashes). Any key of the dictionary is associated (or mapped) to a value. The values of a dictionary can be any Python data type. So dictionaries are unordered key-value-pairs.Dictionaries belong to the built-in mapping type.
